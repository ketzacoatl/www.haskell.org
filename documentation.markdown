# Documentation

You may have heard that learning haskell is a hard. Well, it may take some work, but it does not need to be challenging.

This tutorial series aims to get you off on the right start.

### Getting Started

* See the [Getting started](docs/tutorials/getting-started/) guide for details on how to install the recommended Haskell tools, and a few initial steps to take if you are not sure where to start.
* The [Builder's Guide](docs/tutorials/getting-started/build/) assumes you have installed and started getting familiar with the Haskell tools, and focuses on building simple projects.
* The [Haskell Tools Guide](docs/tutorials/getting-started/tools/) provides a deeper dive into each of the tools commonly used and discussed in the community.

### Additional Resources

Please also see the [additional resources](docs/resources) page for more books, tutorials and general haskell resources from the community.
